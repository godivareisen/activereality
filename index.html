		<p>The impossibility of rediscovering an absolute level of the real is of the same order as the impossibility of staging illusion. Illusion is no longer possible, because the real is no longer possible. It is the whole political problem of parody, of hypersimulation or offensive simulation, that is posed here.</p>
		<p>In the wake of recent mass shootings (over 350 in 2015 alone), active shooter training is in high demand. Training institutes&#8212;often run by current and/or former members of law enforcement or the military&#8212;charge workplaces and schools up to thousands of dollars to deliver lectures or perform active shooter simulations in order to educate civilians on how to react in the event of a real active shooter or violent intruder attack.</p>

		<p>For example: it would be interesting to see whether the repressive apparatus would not react more violently to a simulated holdup than to a real holdup. Because the latter does nothing but disturb the order of things, the right to property, whereas the former attacks the reality principle itself.</p>
		<p>The necessity &#40;much less the demand&#41; of active shooter training bears questioning in the first place. What can the mass shootings that have already happened teach us about the mass shootings yet to come? Can we rely on this expectation of "mass shootings yet to come" as fact? Is our future reality constituted of a recent history of mass shootings?</p>

		<p>Transgression and violence are less serious because they only contest the distribution of the real.</p>
		<p>More and more, the training institutes that coordinate these simulations intend to change the paradigm of reaction in the event of an attack from a passive to an active position. Gone are the days of locking the doors, turning off the lights, and waiting for the police to arrive and address the situation.</p>

		<p>Simulation is infinitely more dangerous because it always leaves open to supposition that, above and beyond its object, law and order themselves might be nothing but simulation. But the difficulty is proportional to the danger. How to feign a violation and put it to the test? Simulate a robbery in a large store: how to persuade security that it is a simulated robbery? There is no "objective" difference: the gestures, the signs are the same as for a real robbery, the signs do not lean to one side or another. To the established order they are always of the order of the real.</p>
		<p>If people cannot rely on the police to save them, then how can they save themselves? Active shooter training programs ask their clients the hypothetical question: What would you do if someone walked in here and started shooting? The space of the hypothetical question maintains a working distance from reality&#8212;it's a safe space where people have the luxury of analyzing the possibility of threat. People can afford to think through their course of action without ever actually carrying it out.</p>

		<p>Organize a fake holdup. Verify that your weapons are harmless, and take the most trustworthy hostage, so that no human life will be in danger (or one lapses into the criminal). Demand a ransom, and make it so that the operation creates as much commotion as possible--in short, remain close to the "truth," in order to test the reaction of the apparatus to a perfect simulacrum.</p>
		<p>It is only in the moment that this question exits the hypothetical and enters into simulation that people understand that it is an attack on their own reality. Some active shooter training programs run simulations in which a shooter enters a room and the people inside are instructed to act according to their instincts. The human brain is calibrated to react by hiding from danger. But if that shooter was in fact intending to shoot (that is, if the shooter broke the simulation in the wrong direction) it would (in all likelihood) only be a matter of a few seconds until the people in the room were dead.</p>

		<p>You won't be able to do it: the network of artificial signs will become inextricably mixed up with real elements (a policeman will really fire on sight; a client of the bank will faint and die of a heart attack; one will actually pay you the phony ransom), in short, you will immediately find yourself once again, without wishing it, in the real, one of whose functions is precisely to devour any attempt at simulation, to reduce everything to the real - that is, to the established order itself, well before institutions and justice come into play.</p>
		<p>The Department of Homeland Security created a program called Run, Hide, Fight, in response to the demand for active shooter training. According to this program, the first (and best) option in the event of an attack is to run. Run where? To know where to run is to know how to break the conventional use paths of a given space. Is there always more than one way out? An unfamiliar space or a space with only one way out may as well be a death trap.</p>

		<p>It is necessary to see in this impossibility of isolating the process of simulation the weight of an order that cannot see and conceive of anything but the real, because it cannot function anywhere else. The simulation of an offense, if it is established as such, will either be punished less severely (because it has no "consequences") or punished as an offense against the judicial system (for example if one sets in motion a police operation "for nothing")&#8212;but never as simulation since it is precisely as such that no equivalence with the real is possible, and hence no repression either.</p>
		<p>If you can't run, then you might be able to hide. Hiding is the second option of action identified by the Department of Homeland Security. But this brings us back to the problem that human instinct posed in the event of an attack in the first place. Cultivating power from under a desk or behind a barricaded door, while in the active shooter's sphere of influence, is a difficult (if not impossible) task.</p>

		<p>The challenge of simulation is never admitted by power. How can the simulation of virtue be punished? However, as such it is as serious as the simulation of crime.</p>
		<p>If you can't run, you can't hide, and the police still haven't arrived, then the third option (and last resort) identified by the Department of Homeland Security is to fight back. In other words, do what the police would do if they were there to help you. But how are people expected to fight back? Training institutes such as the  ALICE (Alert, Lockdown, Inform, Counter, Evacuate) program teach their clients to embrace an active rather than a passive position, if evacuating is not possible. The strategy of repositioning oneself from the defensive to the offensive position, according to training institutes, changes the outcome of the event. In other words, the active shooter shifts from the offensive to the defensive&#8212;in the face of what?</p>

		<p>Parody renders submission and transgression equivalent, and that is the most serious crime, because it cancels out the difference upon which the law is based. The established order can do nothing against it, because the law is a simulacrum of the second order, whereas simulation is of the third order, beyond true and false, beyond equivalences, beyond rational distinctions upon which the whole of the social and power depend. Thus, lacking the real, it is there that we must aim at order.</p>
		<p>Does the average civilian have the physical, mental, or material means to fight back? Is introducing the unexpected enough to throw an active shooter off course? Will throwing your coworker's coffee mug at the shooter prove to be an action in your favor? These training institutes speak as if active shooters operate according to a narrative than can be flipped. They expect that active shooters expect certain behaviors from their victims-to-be. Active shooter simulations accordingly exercise how people can subvert these expected behaviors in their own favor. If the active shooter performs off-script, what are people to do?</p>

		<p>This is certainly why order always opts for the real. When in doubt, it always prefers this hypothesis (as in the army one prefers to take the simulator for a real madman). But this becomes more and more difficult, because if it is practically impossible to isolate the process of simulation, through the force of inertia of the real that surrounds us, the opposite is also true (and this reversibility itself is part of the apparatus of simulation and the impotence of power): namely, it is now impossible to isolate the process of the real, or to prove the real.</p>
		<p>The active shooters and violent intruders who have caused the mass shootings of recent memory all came at their targets from different positions. Two people killed 13 and injured 24 at Columbine High. One killed 32 and injured 17 at Virginia Tech. One killed 13 and injured 32 at Fort Hood. One killed 12 and injured 58 at a movie theatre in Aurora, Colorado. One killed 27 and injured one at Sandy Hook Elementary School. One killed 12 and injured three at the Washington Navy Yard. One killed nine at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina. Two killed 14 and injured 21 at a company holiday party in San Bernardino. Different and unpredictable conditions give rise to mass shootings. All active shooters are not the same.</p>

		<p>This is how all the holdups, airplane hijackings, etc. are now in some sense simulation holdups in that they are already inscribed in the decoding and orchestration rituals of the media, anticipated in their presentation and their possible consequences. In short, where they function as a group of signs dedicated exclusively to their recurrence as signs, and no longer at all to their "real" end. But this does not make them harmless. On the contrary, it is as hyperreal events, no longer with a specific content or end, but indefinitely refracted by each other (just like so-called historical events: strikes, demonstrations, crises, etc.), it is in this sense that they cannot be controlled by an order that can only exert itself on the real and the rational, on causes and ends, a referential order that can only reign over the referential, a determined power that can only reign over a determined world, but that cannot do anything against this indefinite recurrence of simulation, against this nebula whose weight no longer obeys the laws of gravitation of the real, power itself ends by being dismantled in this space and becoming a simulation of power (disconnected from its ends and its objectives, and dedicated to the effects of power and mass simulation).</p>
		<p>Does the "last resort" imperative to fight back against active shooters conceal complicit support of the armed citizen?</p>

		<p>The only weapon of power, its only strategy against this defection, is to reinject the real and the referential everywhere, to persuade us of the reality of the social, of the gravity of the economy and the finalities of production. To this end it prefers the discourse of crisis, but also, why not? that of desire. "Take your desires for reality!" can be understood as the ultimate slogan of power since in a nonreferential world, even the confusion of the reality principle and the principle of desire is less dangerous than contagious hyperreality. One remains among principles, and among those power is always in the right.</p>
		<p>If people continue to run these active shooter simulations constantly in the back of their mind, are people constantly in danger? Is paranoia part and parcel of awareness? Do people need to be physically and mentally weaponized in order to survive?</p>

		<p>Hyperreality and simulation are deterrents of every principle and every objective, they turn against power the deterrent that it used so well for such a long time. Because in the end, throughout its history it was capital that first fed on the destructuration of every referential, of every human objective, that shattered every ideal distinction between true and false, good and evil, in order to establish a radical law of equivalence and exchange, the iron law of its power.</p>
		<p>Safety comes at at price. At the institutional level, it entails hiring a program like ALICE, Crisis Consultant Group, or AEGIS to deliver lectures and perform simulations. At the legislative level, it entails increased spending to enforce gun control.</p>

		<p>Capital was the first to play at deterrence, abstraction, disconnection, deterritorialization, etc., and if it is the one that fostered reality, the reality principle, it was also the first to liquidate it by exterminating all use value, all real equivalence of production and wealth, in the very sense we have of the unreality of the stakes and the omnipotence of manipulation. Well, today it is this same logic that is even more set against capital. And as soon as it wishes to combat this disastrous spiral by secreting a last glimmer of reality, on which to establish a last glimmer of power, it does nothing but multiply the signs and accelerate the play of simulation.</p>
		<p>We will be conducting a full-scale Violent Intruder Emergency Drill this morning at 10 a.m.<br>Please pay attention to any announcements made via the public address system, if audible. You should decide, based on your location, the location of the simulated intruder and your personal circumstances what action you should take, and safely engage in that activity.<br>We will again use our emergency notification system to confirm the end of the exercise.</p>

		<p>As long as the historical threat came at it from the real, power played at deterrence and simulation, disintegrating all the contradictions by dint of producing equivalent signs. Today when the danger comes at it from simulation (that of being dissolved in the play of signs), power plays at the real, plays at crisis, plays at remanufacturing artificial, social, economic, and political stakes. For power, it is a question of life and death. But it is too late.</p>
		<p>Thank you for your participation in this exercise.</p>
